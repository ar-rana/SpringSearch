The most popular out of all these is REST, we will be discussing in brief about what is REST?. Representational state transfer, aka REST, was introduced in 2000 in rRoy Fieldingâ€™s dissertation. REST is an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications.",
    "Rest works in a client-server architecture, it is layered meaning that the client when requesting the data is only aware of the immediate application from which it is getting the request and not any other app/service/DB where that application may be communicating to. Singular things, like json data arrays, in the case of our application, are called resources in RESTful thinking.",
    "REST is stateless, it means one server will get requests from multiple clients and it also means that one server will get multiple requests from the same client as well. It treats all the clients for the same request in the same uniform manner.",
    "In short, REST is a set of guidelines that define how exchange between client and server architecture should happen and how data states should be exchanged between client and server. "
